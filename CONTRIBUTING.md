# Contribution Guidelines

The Arm NN project is open for external contributors and welcomes contributions. Arm NN is licensed under the [MIT license](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html) and all accepted contributions must have the same license. Below is an overview on contributing code to Arm NN.

## Contributing code to Arm NN

All code contributions follow a Pull Request (PR) based workflow:

- Fork the repository: https://github.com/ARM-software/armnn
- Create a branch from the latest main:
  - git checkout main
  - git pull (not required upon initial clone but good practice before creating a patch)
  - git config user.name "FIRST_NAME SECOND_NAME"
  - git config user.email your@email.address
  - git checkout -b your-branch-name
- Commit using sign-off. Keep changes to one commit per PR. Ensure each commit message includes a Signed-off-by line (see DCO section below). Use:
  - git commit -s
- Push your branch to your fork:
  - git push -u <your-remote> your-branch-name
- Open a PR against ARM-software/armnn main.
- Address review feedback by amending, then force-pushing the branch (git push -f). Keep the change in one commit.
