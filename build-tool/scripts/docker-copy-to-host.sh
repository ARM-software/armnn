# Script which copies a file or directory from the /home/arm-user/ directory in Docker to the host machine
# This script creates a directory called 'docker_output' in the current directory and places the copied contents there
# Takes two arguments:
# 1. Name of created Docker image i.e. "--tag <name:tag>" provided at 'docker build' stage (tag is optional in image naming)
# 2. Relative path to file or directory to copy from the Docker /home/arm-user/ directory
#
# Examples:
# 1. Copy the tarball of the aarch64 build from the /home/arm-user/ directory
#    ./scripts/docker-copy-to-host.sh armnn_image armnn_aarch64_build.tar.gz
# 2. Copy the unarchived Arm NN build
#    ./scripts/docker-copy-to-host.sh armnn_image build/armnn
# 3. Copy the unarchived ACL build
#    ./scripts/docker-copy-to-host.sh armnn_image build/acl

set -o nounset  # Catch references to undefined variables.
set -o pipefail # Catch non zero exit codes within pipelines.
set -o errexit  # Catch and propagate non zero exit codes.
